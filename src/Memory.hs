-- | Memory for P
-- | Juan GarcÃ­a Garland

module Memory where

-- | Variables in P are of the form Xk where k is an integer,
-- | The memory is a function from Int (the k idex) to Integer
-- | Since there is no way to declare variables, when an index is accesed for
-- | the first time the value is 0
-- | Performance is NOT important, this structure is O(n) in every operation
